<h1> Lambert Cylindrical </h1>

<p>
This exceedingly simple projection <strong>preserves the area</strong> of
continents. That is the most important property when glancing at a map of the
whole Earth. The first instinct we have is to compare the size of geographic
features of the planet. While things are squeezed and amorph near the poles,
<strong>shapes are accurate near the Equator</strong>.

<section>
<h1> Mercator </h1>
<img alt='Mercator Projection' src='./i/mercator.jpg'>
<p>
This one <strong>preserves angles</strong>, which means that shapes are
accurate. However, everything near the poles is <strong>exceedingly
  inflated</strong>. So much so that the poles are actually infinite and
cannot be represented.

<section>
<h1> Equirectangular </h1>
<img alt='Equirectangular Projection' src='./i/equirectangular.jpg'>
<p>
Notice how <em>meridians</em> (vertical) and <em>parallels</em> (horizontal)
form squares? This projection maintains <strong>heights</strong>. A distance
measured vertically corresponds to the same number of kilometers everywhere on
the map. Of course, a horizontal distance is only the same along the parallel:
as the ruler goes closer to the poles, that distance represents a smaller and
smaller amount of kilometers. (Also, this is a good middle ground of pole
squishiness between Lambert Cylindrical and Mercator.)

<section>
<h1> Interrupted Sinusoidal </h1>
<img alt='Sinusoidal Projection' src='./i/sinusoidal.png'>
<p>
This one is a complement to the Equirectangular. It maintains
<strong>widths</strong>. A horizontal ruler measuring a distance will
correspond to the same number of kilometers throughout the map! Since the
default rendering of this projection makes the map converge to a single dot at
the poles, I favour this interrupted projection (or "<em>gore map</em>"),
which does not distort shapes quite as much. As a bonus, this projection also
<strong>preserves areas</strong>, although it is arguably not as readable as
the Lambert Cylindrical.

<section>
<h1> Winkel Tripel </h1>
<img alt='Winkel Tripel Projection' src='./i/winkel.jpg'>
<p>
We have a lot of maps with many incompatible properties. This projection gives
an approximation of all desirable properties in a map. Hence, the name, German
for "triple": it tries to preserve
<strong>areas, angles and distances</strong>.
