# What I Made In 2017

After some time working on the collaboration between [Captain Train][] and its
acquirer [Trainline][], to bring together both companies’ technologies through a
common protocol, and maintaining the SNCF integration through major evolutions
of their offerings, I left the company to join [Qonto][]

This bank startup that just came out of beta when I joined (I literally removed
the beta tag from the website on my first week) offers the most streamlined
online banking experience for businesses.

I brought together a great team. This year, we will focus on making the backend
banking integration top-notch.

As a result, I had less time for free-time open-source. There were three big
directions to what I did:

- The [Shields.io][] core team increased, and it allowed us to optimize things
  like the [font-width computation][] (hat tip to Paul Melnikow for that).
- I pursue [TheFileTree][], to provide the infrastructure for a self-helping
  community of makers. (It is very far from there yet.) I switched it to using
  the [Canop][] system, which I still have to make support a full JSON, to allow
  for more complex apps. I redid the API and made the app system as designed
  the year before.
- I played with AI in the stride of DeepMind’s [AlphaGo][] effort, and produced
  a Node.js Go library, [badukjs][].

To sum up, this year, I switched focus from “me” to “us”. Great things are not a
lonely job, but an active coordination.

Next year, I will focus on building-block infrastructure for more cooperation.
