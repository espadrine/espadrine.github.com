# What I Did In 2015

- [Passphrase][], a program to generate [good passphrases][]. Providing the entropy gives intuition into how strong they are, and provides an incentive to learn more.
- [Email-Login][], a library for passwordless authentication.
- [Canop][], a synchronization library. It allows collaborative text editing, and will allow offline and history capabilities. While it works with text, I will make it generalize to a JSON data structure, maintained consistent with a centralized server through websockets.
- [RegList][], a library to compile a list of regexes into a single, fast, regex, while keeping the match groups information. It turns out to not provide the expected speedup, which I hope to dig into in the future.

I did a lot of experimentation in 2015. Many failed projects. I also started a few as-of-yet secret projects which I hope will achieve greatness.

One of my failings, however, is how little I explain and advertize my projects. Given that 2015 was a year of experimentation, it is not very surprising. 2016 will need to be a year of development, and 2017 a year of marketing.
