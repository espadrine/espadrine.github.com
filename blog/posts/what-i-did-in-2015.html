<h1>What I Did In 2015</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/espadrine/passphrase">Passphrase</a>, a program to generate <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">good passphrases</a>. Providing the entropy gives intuition into how strong they are, and provides an incentive to learn more.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/espadrine/email-login">Email-Login</a>, a library for passwordless authentication.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/espadrine/canop">Canop</a>, a synchronization library. It allows collaborative text editing, and will allow offline and history capabilities. While it works with text, I will make it generalize to a JSON data structure, maintained consistent with a centralized server through websockets.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/espadrine/reglist">RegList</a>, a library to compile a list of regexes into a single, fast, regex, while keeping the match groups information. It turns out to not provide the expected speedup, which I hope to dig into in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>I did a lot of experimentation in 2015. Many failed projects. I also started a few as-of-yet secret projects which I hope will achieve greatness.</p>
<p>One of my failings, however, is how little I explain and advertize my projects. Given that 2015 was a year of experimentation, it is not very surprising. 2016 will need to be a year of development, and 2017 a year of marketing.</p>
