<h1>What I Made In 2017</h1>
<p>After some time working on the collaboration between <a href="https://trainline.eu">Captain Train</a> and its
acquirer <a href="https://www.thetrainline.com">Trainline</a>, to bring together both companies’ technologies through a
common protocol, and maintaining the SNCF integration through major evolutions
of their offerings, I left the company to join <a href="https://qonto.eu">Qonto</a></p>
<p>This bank startup that just came out of beta when I joined (I literally removed
the beta tag from the website on my first week) offers the most streamlined
online banking experience for businesses.</p>
<p>I brought together a great team. This year, we will focus on making the backend
banking integration top-notch.</p>
<p>As a result, I had less time for free-time open-source. There were three big
directions to what I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://shields.io">Shields.io</a> core team increased, and it allowed us to optimize things
like the <a href="https://github.com/badges/shields/pull/1390">font-width computation</a> (hat tip to Paul Melnikow for that).</li>
<li>I pursue <a href="https://thefiletree.com">TheFileTree</a>, to provide the infrastructure for a self-helping
community of makers. (It is very far from there yet.) I switched it to using
the <a href="https://github.com/espadrine/canop">Canop</a> system, which I still have to make support a full JSON, to allow
for more complex apps. I redid the API and made the app system as designed
the year before.</li>
<li>I played with AI in the stride of DeepMind’s [AlphaGo][] effort, and produced
a Node.js Go library, <a href="https://github.com/espadrine/badukjs">badukjs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up, this year, I switched focus from “me” to “us”. Great things are not a
lonely job, but an active coordination.</p>
<p>Next year, I will focus on building-block infrastructure for more cooperation.</p>
