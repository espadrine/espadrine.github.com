<h1>Opera, an Open-Source Browser?</h1>
<p>I honestly do hope I am not hereby embracing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge">Betteridge’s law of headlines</a>. Please believe me.</p>
<p>Ever since the switch to Chromium away from Presto, I have eagerly waited for the first public snapshot. I expected to get my hands on the code by then.</p>
<p>It is their right to not give direct access to the code, though. The fact that they chose to use that right should not make me suspicious. All I had to do, after all, was <a href="https://twitter.com/opera/status/339658208656375808">email their open-source address</a>, <opensource>. What happened then was rather odd.</p>
<p>But let’s get the facts as they happened. I sent them a mail on May 30th.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good morning / afternoon / evening / night,</p>
<p>I wish to get a copy of the source code for Opera.
May I?
Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,
Thaddée Tyl.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They answered later that day,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Thaddée Tyl,</p>
<p>We have received your request, and information on how to get access will be sent to
via email as soon as we have source package ready.</p>
<p>–
Kind regards,
Haakon
Opera Software
<a href="http:">http:</a>&lt;/http:&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I waited. Two weeks. Then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good morning / afternoon / evening / night,</p>
<p>I am unsure what the situation is on your side related to my
two-weeks-old request, so I decided to ask you. Is the process of
preparing the tarball of Opera’s source ongoing? Have you lost my
email address?</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,
Thaddée Tyl.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the mail system at host smtp-new.opera.com.
I’m sorry to have to inform you that your message could not
be delivered to one or more recipients. It’s attached below.
[…]
<opensource>: User unknown in virtual alias table</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, their old <a href="http://business.opera.com/press/faq/">FAQ</a> still insists that they are not planning to go open-source. From a legal standpoint, they can. Chromium is released under the <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/LICENSE">BSD license</a>, which allows them to keep their fork proprietary — at least, that is my understanding. But then, don’t say <a href="https://twitter.com/opera/status/339658208656375808">you went open-source</a>!</p>
<p>UPDATE: Opera <a href="https://twitter.com/opera/status/345616182738554883">responded</a>. They didn’t delete <opensource> (phew!), but they are moving mail servers. Also, they are still working on packaging the source for the desktop. </opensource></opensource></opensource></p>
