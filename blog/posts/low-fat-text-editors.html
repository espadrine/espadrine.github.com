<h1>Low-Fat Text Edtors</h1>
<p>Memory-wise, after having run for mild editing, the following text editors take the following amount of RAM:</p>
<p>Brackets: more than 124M</p>
<p>Sublime Text: 67M</p>
<p>Kate: 44M</p>
<p>Emacs: 16M</p>
<p>Vim: 8M</p>
<p>Amazingly, each take twice the memory of the next.</p>
<p>(No add-ons except for vim. Emacs with ido-mode on. All running in GUI mode. All in latest version. All having the same (JS) file opened. Figures rounded. Linux KDE.)</p>
<p>It is highly likely that Atom will take about the same as Brackets. I donâ€™t know how the Vim gods did it, but I would need 15 instances (as in, windows with opened buffer) to take the amount of space Brackets takes. Considering I customized it with most features that Sublime / Brackets users benefit from, picture me impressed.</p>
